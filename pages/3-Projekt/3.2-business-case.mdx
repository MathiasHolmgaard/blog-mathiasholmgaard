# Business Case for Developing an Electronic Tech-Log (ETL) at Maersk Air Cargo (MAC)

Denne business case er skrevet på engelsk med det formål at henvende sig til Maersk Air Cargo.


## Company Overview:

**Business Model:**  
Maersk Air Cargo (MAC) operates as an Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance (ACMI) provider for UPS, with its main hub in Cologne, Germany. The company maintains a fleet of 11 Boeing 767 aircraft for this purpose. Additionally, MAC owns and operates a separate cargo company based in Billund, Denmark. This fleet consists of 2 Boeing 767 and 2 Boeing 777 aircraft, primarily servicing routes to China, with additional ad hoc charter operations.

#### **Business Issues:**

1. **Carbon Emissions Tracking:**  
   * MAC faces challenges in accurately tracking and accounting for carbon emissions due to discrepancies between pilot entries in paper tech-logs and data entered in the current Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) system.  
   * The current system lacks functionality for recording maintenance activities that result in additional fuel burn, such as starting the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) during maintenance, posing a risk of significant fines due to inaccurate carbon footprint reporting.  
2. **Data Management and Insight Generation:**  
   * The current system does not effectively store data for future use in predictions or insights, hindering the company's ability to leverage data for operational improvements.  
3. **Manual Data Reconciliation:**  
   * MAC currently employs student workers to manually compare tech-log entries with the EFB system, a process that is time-consuming (30-40 hours per week) and prone to errors (discrepancies found 95% of the time).  
4. **Flight Hours and Cycles Management:**  
   * Managing flight hours and cycles is a significant challenge, contributing to inefficiencies in maintenance scheduling and compliance tracking.

#### **Stakeholders:**

* **Lars Jordahn (CEO):** Although not directly involved in the development process, his support is critical for project approval.  
* **Steffen Vagt-Andersen (Maintenance Planning Manager):** Appointed as the Product Owner, Steffen will be closely involved in the development and implementation process.  
* **Claus E. Nielsen (Vice President Technical):**  will act as Quality Assurance on the final product.  
* **Student Workers:** Their insights into the manual reconciliation process will inform system requirements.  
* **Pilots:** Select pilots will provide feedback on key functionalities and system usability.  
* **Technicians:** Key technicians will contribute valuable insights into system requirements and user experience.  
* **Danish CAA:** Has no direct interest in development, but they need to be consulted for approval of the final product. They may have some additional requirement to the system/product

#### **System Users:**

* **Technicians**  
* **Pilots**  
* **Administrators**

## Scenario Overview:

**Scenario 0: Continue with the Current System**

* **Pros:**  
  * No immediate investment required.  
  * Users are familiar with the current system and processes.  
  * Avoidance of short-term disruptions during a system changeover.  
* **Cons:**  
  * Ongoing manual data reconciliation, leading to high labor costs and inefficiency.  
  * Inconsistent carbon emissions tracking, increasing the risk of fines.  
  * Lack of data storage for predictive analysis and insights.  
  * Inefficient management of flight hours and cycles.

**Scenario 1: Develop a Simple Electronic Tech-Log**

* **Pros:**  
  * Reduction in manual processes and associated labor costs.  
  * Improved accuracy in carbon emissions tracking.  
  * Better data storage for future analysis.  
  * Provides a foundation for digital transformation with relatively lower initial investment.  
  * Easier and faster to implement compared to a more complex solution.  
* **Cons:**  
  * Limited functionality compared to more sophisticated systems.  
  * May still require some manual reconciliation.  
  * Potential for future upgrades and associated costs.

**Scenario 2: Develop a Sophisticated Electronic Tech-Log**

* **Pros:**  
  * Full automation of data entry and validation, reducing errors and labor costs.  
  * Advanced features like predictive maintenance, fleet optimization, and smart recommendations, which can lead to long-term operational efficiencies.  
  * Integration with other systems (e.g., CAMP, AMOS) for comprehensive fleet management.  
  * Advanced reporting and compliance tracking, reducing regulatory risk.  
  * Significant long-term operational efficiencies and data-driven decision-making.  
  * Tailored to MAC’s specific operational needs, ensuring optimal functionality and user experience.  
* **Cons:**  
  * Higher initial development and implementation costs.  
  * Longer development time and potential for disruption during rollout.  
  * Greater complexity requiring ongoing maintenance and potential future updates.

#### **Scenario 3: Acquire an Existing Electronic Tech-Log Provider**

* **Pros:**  
  * Immediate access to a mature, market-tested solution with proven reliability.  
  * Comprehensive features and functionalities that are likely already compliant with industry standards and regulations.  
  * Faster implementation and deployment compared to developing a custom solution from scratch.  
  * The acquisition could include access to the provider’s expertise, support, and future software updates.  
  * Integration capabilities with existing systems (e.g., EFB, maintenance software) are likely to be well-developed.  
* **Cons:**  
  * Higher upfront costs associated with acquisition and potential customization to meet specific MAC requirements.  
  * Potential challenges in integrating the acquired system with MAC’s existing IT infrastructure.  
  * Risk of vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and potentially increasing long-term costs.  
  * The acquired system may include features that MAC does not need, leading to inefficiencies or unnecessary complexity.  
  * Cultural or operational misalignment between the acquired company and MAC’s internal processes could pose challenges during implementation.

#### **Chosen scenario:** Scenario 1: Initial Implementation of a Simple Electronic Tech-Log

* **Basis for the decision**:  
  * It is decided to move along with scenario 1, as this alone can give a better overview of the company’s carbon emissions in the long term than the current system in place, and it can get rid of a lot of manual processes/labor. And if this delivers on its promise, development can continue to create a more sophisticated system.

* **Main Goals:**  
  * Eliminate manual processes associated with tech-log data entry and reconciliation.  
  * Provide an accurate picture of MAC’s carbon emissions/carbon footprint.  
  * Store valuable operational data for future use and analysis.  
  * Reduce the costs associated with producing and storing paper tech-logs.  
  * Enhance user experience for pilots and technicians through a seamless, digital interface.
